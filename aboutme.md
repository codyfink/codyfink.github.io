subtitle: Learning to design intuitive user experiences that delight customers.
---

My name is Cody Fink and I'm a part-time Lambda School student. I'm currently learning user research and have experience with the following tools:

- Sketch
- Invision
- Milanote
- Whimsical

Currently working as a paraprofessional at a public library and transitioning into the world of design. Share technology skills and provide hands-on learning through community outreach programs. Observing customer behavior is my jam! Also volunteer and show greenhorns the ropes at a no-kill animal shelter.

You can find me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@codyfink) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codyfink). We can connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codyfink) as well.
